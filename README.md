I analyzed the sample completeness between two land use types (silvopastoral and peasant) with a non-asymptotic approach based on rarefaction and extrapolation of incidence data for standardized
samples with iNEXT package (Hsieh et al., 2020). Also, I calculated Shannon and Simpson diveristy index.
